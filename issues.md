#### No ROM in the chip
Need to ask what that means (can think of three possible options):
* Instructions memory (most probable)
 - Data Memory (probable)
 * Register memory (least probable)

#### Power-on-Reset
Where does that come in? Before DUT boots or maybe after? When the whole PCB is connected to Power Supply?
